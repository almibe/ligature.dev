# Sisal

Sisal is a plugin for 11ty that integrates Ligature.
It integrates at a couple of different points all of which can be used independently.

## Wander Data Files

The main way of using Ligature from 11ty projects is to use Wander files to provide content for your site.
`.wander` files can be placed in the `_data` directory and they will be processed by sisal.
