# What is Ligature?

Ligature is a libre (free and open source, MPL-2.0 licensed) knowledge representation toolkit that focuses on simplicity, pragmatism, and portability.
It is currently under heavy design and development, and not ready for real world use, but experimentation and feedback are encouraged and much welcomed.
