# Update July 2021

Hello, I wanted to post a quick update on Ligature.
This month I've still been focusing on the ligature-js project.
The month started with updating ligature-lab and implementing a simple store for Ligature using indexeddb,
and ended with spending most of my time working with parsing in JS for both the lig serialization format project
and the Wander scripting language.

Like I mentioned the simple indexeddb persistance library is done for now as well as support for the lig serialization format.
I suspect working on Wander will continue through this month.
I also have plans to update ligature-lab to use lig and Wander and I'm still planning on rewriting this site to use sveltekit in place of 11ty.
I plan on doing additional write-ups as this work is finished.
