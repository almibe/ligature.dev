## Homosaurus Case Study

I first heard about the Homosaurus at a brown bag talk hosted by my employer.
From its [website](https://homosaurus.org/) Homosaurus describes itself as follows.

```
The Homosaurus is an international linked data vocabulary of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) terms. This vocabulary is intended to function as a companion to broad subject term vocabularies, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Libraries, archives, museums, and other institutions are encouraged to use the Homosaurus to support LGBTQ research by enhancing the discoverability of their LGBTQ resources.
