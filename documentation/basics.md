# Ligature Basics

Hello!
Welcome to the first interactive tutorial for Ligature.
This tutorial will introduce basic commands and concepts for working with Ligature and Wander.
It is expected that you've read the Introduction to Ligature.
In this tutorial I will be covering the basic Wander commands for working with Ligature.
I will over cover how to work with datasets in an append-only manner by thinking about data as a series of events rather than mutating existing data and mention some of the benefits of this approach.

## &lt;blink&gt;Heads Up!&lt;/blink&gt;

Ligature is a new project and is still under heavy design and development.
Consider this pre-alpha software that is likely to change and shouldn't be used anywhere except locally for experimentation and education.

## How this Tutorial Works

On this page you find text interpersed with areas like this:

[TODO show textbox w/ Run, Check, Halp! Buttons]
 
These boxes allow you to execute Wander commands against an embedded instance of Ligature that running in this page via JavaScript.
Nothing you type in these boxes will leave your machine.
All of the boxes are running against the same instance.
As you follow through the steps we'll be building upon commands ran in previous steps.

The Run button will run the command you have entered.
It will also check if the Dataset is in the correct state and give you a status message.

If you just want to double check you are in the correct state without running a command you can use the Check button.

If you are having issues the Halp! button provides the following assistance.
 - Explain what is missing or incorrect in the current Dataset.
 - Allow you to refresh the Dataset back the previous step's correct state.
 - Allow you to see and run the solution for the current step.

Of course if you aren't required to use the embedded version of Ligature.
You can follow along with this tutorial in your own local instance of Ligature as well.
See [Running Ligature](./running-ligature) for more information on running Ligature locally.

## 1 - The Basics of Ligature

Ligature is a knowledge graph that stores data as a set of triples.
Each set of triples belongs to a Dataset and an instance of Ligature can contain multiple Datasets.
